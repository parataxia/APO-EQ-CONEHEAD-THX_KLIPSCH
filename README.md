# APO-EQ-CONEHEAD-THX_KLIPSCH
Comes with bundled settings to simply import from File Explorer mostly!


`' Install APO Equalizer and Peace concurrently, apply peace.txt included as preset entirely ("C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config") along with config.txt in same directory structure.. Load VSTs using wrapper within APO Control Panel, and apply IR file as well which should be present after loading both config files.. Comes with three bitrates (48/92/192) to fulfill each setting of given set up.. Perfect conehead set up for 2.1 once I expanded with gating and the rest, about ~40 settings included. 

Make sure to load IGNITE AMP with given JSON file as well! And adjust "BootEQmkIV (64).dll" to your own devices.

BTW: You will need to change audio mapping within the peace.txt configuration to remap to your own audio device easily enough within APO Control Panel!


Enjoy!``
